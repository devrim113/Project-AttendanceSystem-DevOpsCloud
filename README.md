# Project: Attendance System to Cloud

## Description
A university wants to migrate its attendance system to the cloud. The
solution should require minimal maintenance for the engineers who
manage the AWS cloud environment as they already have a staff
shortage. One of the engineers suggested a serverless solution to
reduce infrastructure maintenance to limit additional work on
infrastructure for the IT department.

## Requirements
1. An attendance registration system prototype with back and
front-end
2. Scalability to handle peak traffic
3. Automated deployment of back and front-end
4. All code must be void of plaintext secrets

## Expected output
1. Design of the created solution.
2. Working attendance registration system.
3. A system that scales out during peak traffic.
4. A solution deployed via DevOps best practices
    a. Documentation is generated
    b. Deployed via pipeline(s)
    c. Secret management is applied
